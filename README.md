## Hi there, fellow coder ðŸ‘‹
---
I am a [C#](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang)/[.NET](https://github.com/microsoft/dotnet) software engineer. Most of the work I do is closed source so, unfortunately, you will not find much here.

I'm:
- ðŸŒ± currently learning [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular)
- â˜• powered by coffee
- ðŸ’» a clean code advocate
- ðŸ¤“ overall, a code quality geek
